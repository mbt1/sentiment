This is the proposed architecture for the Mastodon sentiment analysis application. 

### Model Training with OpenAI-Generated Data

1. **Data Collection**: Use Python or other tools to collect and preprocess text data. You could potentially use OpenAI's GPT models to generate synthetic training data.

2. **Training the Model**: Use a machine learning library like TensorFlow or PyTorch to train your model. You can host your training on cloud services like Azure ML.

3. **Continuous Training with GitHub Actions**: Automate the training using GitHub Actions whenever new data is pushed to your repository. This pipeline can push the trained model to Azure Blob Storage or directly to your Azure Function app.

4. **Hosting the Model**: Azure ML or Azure Functions with a custom container can serve your trained model.

### Python Backend on Azure Functions

1. **API Endpoints**: Set up HTTP-triggered Azure Functions for your endpoints. One function could take a Mastodon username as a parameter and return the user's latest toots with sentiment analysis.

2. **Calling the ML Model**: Your function should be able to make HTTP requests to your Azure ML model (or load it in-memory, if possible) to get sentiment analysis results.

3. **Response**: Use JSON responses that include the original toot and the sentiment analysis.

4. **Security**: Use API keys or Azure AD for secure API access.

5. **Environment Variables**: Use Azure Function app settings for secure storage of sensitive data like API keys. Access these in your code using the `os` library in Python.

### React Frontend on GitHub Pages

1. **API Consumption**: Your React app should be able to make HTTP requests to your Azure Function API and display the results.

2. **State Management**: Use React's built-in state management or libraries like Redux to handle application state.

3. **Deployment**: Use GitHub Actions to build and deploy your React app to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

4. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files or GitHub Secrets for frontend environment variables like the API URL.

### Integration

1. **Backend to Model**: Use HTTP requests or Azure SDKs to call your hosted model for analysis.
  
2. **Frontend to Backend**: Use HTTP requests to fetch and send data to and from your Azure Function API.

3. **CORS**: Make sure CORS settings are correctly set in your Azure Function to accept requests from your GitHub Pages domain.

4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting on your Azure Function to prevent abuse.

Each of these components could be in a monorepo. Make sure to have good README files for each so that any developer can understand how to run or contribute to each component.
